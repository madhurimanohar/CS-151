# Object Oriented Design

#### Overview:

---

Design of classes and interfaces. Object-oriented design methodologies and notations. Design patterns. Generics and reflection.
Exception handling. Concurrent programming. Graphical user interface programming. Software engineering concepts and tools.

#### Goals:

---

- OO Design:
  - Introduce core UML concepts
  - Introduce a simplified OO analysis and design methodology
  - Present the concept of design pattern
  - Present the concept of a software framework
- Java Language:
  - Become proficient in the use and creation of interfaces and inheritance hierarchies
  - Become proficient in the Java type system
  - Introduce threads and thread safety
- Software Engineering:
  - Introduce a GUI toolkit, including basic widgets and the event handling mechanism
  - Introduce basic software engineering concepts and tools

#### Outcomes:

---

- OO Design
  - Interpret and produce UML class diagrams and UML sequence diagrams
  - Develop simple use cases, perform noun-verb analysis, interpret and produce CRC cards
  - Appropriately select and apply key design patterns in the construction of a software application
  - Be able to follow a systematic OO design methodology
- Java language
  - Create a class hierarchy involving existing and new interfaces and classes, including inner classes.
  - Design, implement, test, and debug programs in an object-oriented language, involving the creation of at least 10 classes and interfaces
  - Use generic types, reflection, and lambda expressions
  - Implement concurrent programs and use thread-safe data structures
- Software Engineering
  - Use a GUI toolkit to create a graphical user interface involving frames, buttons, text components, panels, menus, and simple geometric shapes
  - Be able to document use cases for a simple team project
  - Be able to plan and track a simple team project
  - Be able to use a version control system and an automated build system
