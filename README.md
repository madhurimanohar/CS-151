# Object Oriented Design

#### Overview:

---

Design of classes and interfaces. Object-oriented design methodologies and notations. Design patterns. Generics and reflection.
Exception handling. Concurrent programming. Graphical user interface programming. Software engineering concepts and tools.

#### Goals:

---

• OO Design:
o Introduce core UML concepts
o Introduce a simplified OO analysis and design methodology
o Present the concept of design pattern
o Present the concept of a software framework
• Java Language:
o Become proficient in the use and creation of interfaces and inheritance hierarchies
o Become proficient in the Java type system
o Introduce threads and thread safety
• Software Engineering:
o Introduce a GUI toolkit, including basic widgets and the event handling mechanism
o Introduce basic software engineering concepts and tools

#### Outcomes:

---

• OO Design
o Interpret and produce UML class diagrams and UML sequence diagrams
o Develop simple use cases, perform noun-verb analysis, interpret and produce CRC cards
o Appropriately select and apply key design patterns in the construction of a software application
o Be able to follow a systematic OO design methodology
• Java language
o Create a class hierarchy involving existing and new interfaces and classes, including inner classes.
o Design, implement, test, and debug programs in an object-oriented language, involving the creation of at least 10 classes and interfaces
o Use generic types, reflection, and lambda expressions
o Implement concurrent programs and use thread-safe data structures
• Software Engineering
o Use a GUI toolkit to create a graphical user interface involving frames, buttons, text components, panels, menus, and simple geometric shapes
o Be able to document use cases for a simple team project
o Be able to plan and track a simple team project
o Be able to use a version control system and an automated build system
