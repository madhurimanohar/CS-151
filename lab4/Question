You want to design a new Abstract Data Type called Sequence. 
A Sequence object contains other objects. 
Clients need access to the elements, and a Sequence object should not expose its underlying data structure. 
There may be multiple clients that need simultaneous access. 
Write a Sequence class that follows the Iterator pattern. 
Use a partially filled array as the underlying data structure of the Sequence ADT. 
Write a minimum amount of code that includes classes, interfaces, and methods required by the Iterator pattern.
 
 interface/class					Methods defined in the interface/class
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Iterator <E> boolean hasNext()		Returns true if the iteration has more elements
 E next()							Returns the next element in the iteration
 void remove()						optional operation
