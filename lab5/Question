Write MVCTester.java. When the program starts, the initial screen displays a button labeled "add", a blank text area, and a text field. 
A user places a line in the text field and clicks on the add button. 
Then, the text area displays the line. 
Each time the user enters a new line in a text field and clicks on the add button, the text area is updated displaying previously entered lines and the new line. 
The following picture shows the snapshot of the program output right after two lines are added.

1. The program follows the MVC model.
2. Listeners are implemented in an anonymous class.
3. Model is a separate class from the client (test) program.
4. The indication of which part of your program serves as model, controller or view.
